To run Inception v3:

```
python iv3.py
```

Based on tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/image_recognition/index.html and ArXiv paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567

The ```./fig``` directory contains figures generated for each layer in the model; ```./img``` contains the images used inputs (each subdirectory is a category); ```./graph``` has the code for creating the TensorBoard graph of Inception v3; ```./arXiv:1512.00567``` contains the source files for the relevant arXiv paper.
